Prior to the start of the workshop everyone will need to have had the software 
installed and tested.  Install of R, RStudio and Strawberry Perl does not require an open source software form.  EZ Tech has it set up so that they can simply push the install, remotely, to your machines.  The current installs via this method are a bit dated.  The process has been started to update these and hopefully the most recent versions of all the required software will be available from EZ Tech in a few weeks.

Once we have the attendees for the workshop finalized, we will collect names and make a single request for everyone to have R, RStudio and Strawberry Perl updated and/or installed.  As soon as we know this has happened, it would be great to make sure it works for everyone.  Follow the instructions below to test your installation.

## Open RStudio
Once installed, RStudio should be accessible from the start menu.  Start up RStudio.  Once running it should look something like:

![RStudio Window](/introR/figure/rstudio.png)

## Find "Console" window
By default the console window will be on the left side of RStudio.  Find that window.  It will looking something like:  

![RStudio Console](/introR/figure/rstudio_console.png)

## Copy and paste the code
Click in the window and paste in the code from below:

```{r eval=FALSE}
version$version.string
```

## It should say...

```{r echo=FALSE}
version$version.string
```
